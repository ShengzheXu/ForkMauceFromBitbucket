     * @brief This function finds and moves all Vectors in the range that are dominated by others.
     *
     * This function performs simple comparisons between all Vectors in the
     * range, and is thus much more performant than a full-fledged prune, since
     * that would need to solve multiple linear programming problems. However,
     * this function will not return the truly parsimonious set of
     * Vectors, as its pruning powers are limited.
     *
     * Dominated elements will be moved at the end of the range for safe removal.
     *
     * @param N The number of elements in each Vector.
     * @param begin The begin of the list that needs to be pruned.
     * @param end The end of the list that needs to be pruned.
     *
     * @return The iterator that separates dominated elements with non-pruned.
